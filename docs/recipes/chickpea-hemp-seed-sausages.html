I like to use the microwave by warming the water for about 1-2 minutes in a glass measuring cup. Add the spices to the boiling water (Worcestershire to salt &amp; pepper/cayenne) and set aside.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile combine 1/2 cup chickpea flour, 1 cup hemp seeds and 2 tablespoon of either ground flax or chia seed in a large bowl. Mix them together and set aside.</p><p></p><p>Warm the teaspoon of olive oil over medium heat in a skillet and then add half of the beans. Pour in 1/2 cup of the spice liquid and then use a fork to mash the beans. Stir in one tablespoon of the chickpea flour and then allow them to cook over a low boil for 2-3 minutes so that they absorb some of the liquid.</p><p></p><p>Place the remaining half of the beans in the skillet along with the remaining 1/2 cup of spice liquid and repeat the process above by mashing them with a fork, stirring the second tablespoon of chickpea flour, and then cooking for another 2-3 minutes.</p><p></p><p>Pour the bean mixture into the bowl with the flour and hemp seeds and stir until well combined. Allow to cool to room temperature then chill in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.</p><p></p><p>Once the mixture is cool and has thickened some, preheat the oven to 400Â°F and then take out heaping tablespoons with your hands and form them into small patties. Place the patties on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes on each side.</p><p></p><p>At this point you can eat them as is or warm them in a skillet with a touch of oil. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 2 months.</p></article></body></html>
